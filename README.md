# POE-Trade-Toggle
Toggle your online status on poe.trade with autohotkey(handy for maps). I'm not an ahk guru by any means, so if you have improvements feel free to send a pull request

# Instructions
1. Save [tradetoggle.ahk](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/teuneboon/POE-Trade-Toggle/master/tradetoggle.ahk) somewhere on your computer
2. Open it in notepad
3. Replace the url on the first line with your poe.trade status url(as received in your inbox on the poe forums)
4. [OPTIONAL] Replace F8 and F9 on line 5 and 11 with the key combination you want. To use ```ctrl``` use ```^``` instead, to use ```alt``` use ```!``` instead. i.e: ```^!p::``` for ctrl+alt+p
5. Run tradetoggle.ahk
6. Everything should be in order now, if you didn't change anything in step 4 use F8 to come online and F9 to go offline
