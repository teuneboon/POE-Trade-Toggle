# POE-Trade-Toggle
Toggle your online status on poe.trade with autohotkey. I'm not an ahk guru by any means, so if you have improvements feel free to send a pull request

# Instructions
1. Download tradetoggle.ahk
2. Open it in notepad
3. Replace the url on the first line with your poe.trade status url
4. Replace F8 and F9 on line 5 and 11 with the key combination you want. To use ```ctrl``` use ```^``` instead, to use ```alt``` use ```!``` instead. i.e: ```^!p::``` for ctrl+alt+p
